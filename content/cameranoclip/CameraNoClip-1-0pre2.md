## Features
- Removes the annoying camera snapping effect in third-person mode
- Allows the camera to move around freely, without snapping to nearby blocks and entities
- Improves user comfort during gameplay
- Compatible with both Fabric and Forge

## Important Notes
- This mod is client-side only, meaning it does not need to be installed on a server for you to enjoy its benefits.
- Make sure you have the latest version of Fabric or Forge installed for Minecraft 1.19.
- When using Fabric, you need to install a compatible version of the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/versions) as well.
