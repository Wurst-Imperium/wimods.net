**Note:** In snapshot 23w05a, due to a [bug in Fabric](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/issues/2879), the zoom keybind does not show up in the controls menu. You can still zoom, but can't change the keybind right now. The Fabric team is [working on a fix](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader/pull/764).
