## Changelog

- Zoom will now dynamically adjust your mouse sensitivity while zooming, so that high levels of zoom will not cause the camera to move too quickly. (Thanks to [Mersid](https://github.com/Mersid)!)

## Features

- Up to 50x zoom
- Zoom in and out with the mouse wheel
- No wobbly camera nonsense
- Dynamic mouse sensitivity
- Fully compatible with OptiFine
