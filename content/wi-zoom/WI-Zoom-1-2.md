## Changelog

- Changed the mod ID from `wi-zoom` to `wi_zoom`.

- Fabric Loader will now show a proper error message and refuse to launch the game if you try to use both WI Zoom and [Wurst](https://www.wurstclient.net/). Previously the game would just crash.

  (You don't need WI Zoom if you have Wurst. The zoom is already included in Wurst and having it twice will crash the game.)

- Fixed the name of the Zoom keybind saying "key.wi-zoom.zoom". If you have changed your zoom keybind to a different key, you may need to change it again because the name has changed.

- Fixed the mod info shown in Fabric Mod Menu.

## Features

- Up to 50x zoom
- Zoom in and out with the mouse wheel
- No wobbly camera nonsense
- Dynamic mouse sensitivity
- Fully compatible with OptiFine
