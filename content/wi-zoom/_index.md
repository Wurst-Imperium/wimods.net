**NOTE:** Do not install this if you have the Wurst Client. This is already included in Wurst and having it twice will crash the game.

## Will you add Forge support?

Aside from the 1.12.2 Forge version that already exists, no. A modern Forge version is not being considered due to <a href="https://forums.minecraftforge.net/topic/58706-regarding-minecraft-112-and-policy-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forge's new CoreMod policy</a> (effective since 1.13) as well as issues with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201125032822/https://gist.github.com/jellysquid3/629eb84a74ab326046faf971150dc6c3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forge community's treatment of modders</a>.

However, the experimental&nbsp;<a href="https://patchworkmc.net/">Patchwork</a> project can sometimes make Forge mods and Fabric mods work together. Depending on which other mods you use, this might work with WI Zoom.

Also, keep in mind that many former Forge mods now have Fabric versions (or have switched to Fabric entirely due to the above-mentioned issues).
