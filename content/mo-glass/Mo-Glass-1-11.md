## Changelog

- Added a test that checks if the names of Mo Glass's items show up correctly. (An unreleased build of Mo Glass for 24w45a had a bug where you would see the raw translation keys instead.)

- Added a test that checks if all of Mo Glass's crafting and stonecutting recipes work. (Mo Glass 1.8 had a bug where all recipes stopped working in Minecraft 1.20.5/6.)

- Added a test that checks thousands of different combinations of glass blocks, stairs, and slabs to make sure they all connect properly to each other.

- Added a test that checks if the tinted glass slabs and stairs correctly block light depending on their orientation. (An unreleased build of Mo Glass for 24w33a had a bug where they stopped blocking light.)

- Added a test that checks if all of the glass slabs and stairs drop the correct items when mined with and without silk touch.

- Fixed a bug where non-tinted glass slabs would not connect to inner curved stairs of the same type, if those stairs were 90Â° rotated relative to the slab and either the slab was a double slab or the stairs were upside down relative to the slab. Confusing, I know, but just check the example screenshots and it will make sense: [example 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7224a67c-e178-46c2-aa66-b0914428e388), [example 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3591e4d7-db4a-48a3-a2f1-d0bf857d2db2), [example 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4725620-3280-4532-8a68-f40feecc3284)

- Fixed a bug where there would be a hole in the side of inner curved glass stairs when placed next to another glass stair in certain orientations. ([example 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12228a4e-f6aa-48bd-966d-2a95d9b08f64), [example 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9e7ebae-1c20-4758-a8f9-f252b98eae4f))

- Fixed a bug where inner curved glass stairs would have a hole in their front side if you used a debug stick to make them curve towards something that they normally couldn't. ([example 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da85770d-92e1-44b7-985b-ffb575136c98), [example 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0439eee6-e8ad-4138-ba88-a007e5de62ad), [example 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22b313e0-6384-42de-8f97-089505b66779))

- Fixed various scenarios in which outer curved glass stairs would not connect to other glass stairs correctly. ([example 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3166d9ee-d2ea-4177-8bee-e8d5c08a4a8e), [example 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d07332b-7273-4351-bc42-bcd6ab5c9602), [example 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/245a2f3a-905d-4cc7-a3bb-f749acc606da), [example 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65a69f49-f59e-4e3d-b2bd-0524c5639cc7), [example 5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2022f192-433b-48e5-ab08-172303e6bf5a), [example 6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bb50e8f-7a04-4f7a-beac-317ba6d92d81))

- Fixed a bug in the loot tables causing non-tinted glass slabs and stairs to drop as items when being mined without silk touch. (Only tinted glass is supposed to do this.)
