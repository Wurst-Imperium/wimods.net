## Installation

<p class="set-border padding10 bd-violet">
    <strong>Important:</strong>
    Always make sure that your modloader and all of your mods are made for the same Minecraft version.
    Your game will crash if you mix different versions.
</p>

### Installation using Fabric

1. Install [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/).
2. Add [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) to your mods folder.
3. Add ChestESP to your mods folder.

<p class="set-border padding10 bd-blue">
    <strong>Note:</strong>
    Older ChestESP versions also required that you add
    <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config" rel="nofollow">Cloth Config</a> and
    <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu" rel="nofollow">ModMenu</a> to your mods folder.
    As of ChestESP 1.2, you no longer need to do this.
</p>

### Installation using NeoForge

1. Install [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net/).
2. Add ChestESP to your mods folder.

## Usage

Once installed, ChestESP will automatically highlight any nearby chests.

The mod also comes with an in-game settings menu that can be accessed through ModMenu in Fabric or the built-in mod list in NeoForge.

In the settings menu, you can:
- Change the style of the highlights (boxes, lines, or both).
- Customize the color of each container type.
- Toggle on/off specific container types.
- Enable/disable the entire mod.

There is also a "Toggle ChestESP" entry in the Options > Controls > Key Binds menu that allows you to quickly enable/disable the mod at the press of a button. This feature is not bound to any key by default.

## Supported containers

ChestESP supports the following container types:
- Chests
- Trapped chests
- Ender chests
- Barrels
- Shulker boxes
- Decorated pots
- Chest minecarts
- Chest boats
- Hopper minecarts
- Hoppers
- Droppers
- Dispensers
- Furnaces
- Blast furnaces
- Smokers

Not all of these containers are enabled by default to prevent cluttering your screen. Be sure to check the settings menu and enable all the ones you want.
