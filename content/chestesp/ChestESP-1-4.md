## Changelog

- ChestESP now also works with barrels and shulker boxes from the Lootr mod. ([#28](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/ChestESP/issues/28))

- Migrated ChestESP's automated tests to the Fabric Client GameTest API, even on NeoForge and older Minecraft versions where this API usually wouldn't exist.

- Added crafters and bamboo chest rafts to the test setup.
